# AppWeekly

Welcome to App Weekly, the project where creativity meets application. The goal is to come up with a new, innovative application every week designed to solve everyday problems and make life a little bit easier. It's about exploring the depths of creativity, learning, and growing together while creating something extraordinary.

## The First Application - Memo

The first application created as part of this project is 'Memo'. Memo is an application designed to help you summarize and derive key takeaways from your meetings. Just input any public URL video, including Google Drive videos, and Memo will handle the rest. It will download your video, extract the audio, and then it will give you the summary of the meeting with recommendations. All files are deleted after processing to ensure your data's privacy.

## Open Source

The source code for all the applications developed as part of App Weekly is open for everyone. Feel free to dive in, explore, and contribute to make these applications better. 

## Get Involved

If you're as passionate about innovation and creativity as I am, join the journey. Try out the applications, contribute to the source code, and share your thoughts and opinions on them.
